# R project - Happinness Scores Analysis

# Group: Parimal Maurya, Rashi Singh, Fausto Diodati

# The dataset we retrieved from "Kaggle" is analyzed to determine the relationship between Happiness Index Score in 2018 and a number of
# independent variables such as 'Overall rank', 'GDP per capita', 'Social support', 'Healthy life expectancy', 'Freedom to make life choices',
# 'Generosity' and 'Perceptions of corruption'.
# The dataset is composed of Happiness Index scores of 156 countries
# along with information regarding Their per capita GDP which represents the economic well-being of citizens,
# The social support quantifies the degree to which people have access to social networks including family and friends,
# The healthy life expectancy measures how long people may expect to live in excellent health
# The freedom to make decisions in life demonstrates how much control and autonomy people have over their lives,
# and finally, The perception of corruption helps us to understand how prevalent it is in that society.

# Aim of our study is to understand how GDP per capita affects Freedom to make Life decisions, Life expectancy and Happiness Score. 
# We are testing our 3 Hypothesis.
# Hypothesis 1: There is a strong relation between GDP per capita and Freedom 
# Hypothesis 2: There is a strong relation between GDP per capita and Life Expectancy 
# Hypothesis 3: There is a strong relation between GDP per capita and Happiness Score

# The information included in the dataset includes the following variables:
# Overall rank: the number of total countries observed
# Quantitative - numeric
# Original Variable Name: Overall rank
# Country or region: The countries whose above mentioned varaibles are calculated
# Qualitative - character
# Original Variable Name: Country or region
# Happiness score :The score of each country
# Qualitative - double

# We want to focus our analysis on a subdataset of the initial, so we have extracted parameters we were interested in using following code
year2018sub <- year_2018[ ,c("Country.or.region", "GDP.per.capita", "Healthy.life.expectancy", "Freedom.to.make.life.choices")]

# Renaming some parameters to make our study easy

# Confirming the changes

# Using summary function to have an idea of lower, highest, and central tendency
summary(year2018sub)

# We create a new column in the year_2018sub dataframe called "Development" that categorizes countries based on their GDP per capita.
# First, we determined the cutoffs for each category
developed_cutoff <- quantile(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita, 0.75)
developing_cutoff <- quantile(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita, 0.5)

# Then we used the ifelse() function to assign each country to a category based on their GDP per capita.
year2018sub$Development <- ifelse(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita >= developed_cutoff, "Developed", ifelse(year_2018$GDP.per.capita >= developing_cutoff, "Developing", "Underdeveloped"))

# Using barplot to represent it graphically
barplot(table(year2018sub$Development), main = "Categories based on per capita GDP")
# Comment on the graph
# The barplot shows that the number of developed and developing nations is identical while the number of underdeveloped nations is approximately twice as large.

# Now we use grouped boxplot to show different categories
boxplot(year_2018[,4:9], main="Happiness Factors in 2018",
        xlab="Factors", ylab="Score", col=c("orange","yellow","green","blue","purple","red"))
# Comment on the graph
# The boxplot is used to study the different factors and their relation with Happiness Score 
# Social Support, Freedom and Generosity show a normal distribution while perception of corruption is positively skewed. 
# GDP per capita and Life expectancy are negatively skewed. 
# Focusing on the interquartile range of the boxplots, we can say that data about GDP per capita, Social support and Life Expectancy is more dispersed as their range is larger. 

# Focusing on the relation between GDP and Development
year2018sub %>%

# Comment on the graph
# Barplot shows the data distribution of 3 categories: Developed, Developing and Underdeveloped based on their GDP. 
# None of them have a normal distribution. Developed and Underdeveloped category is negatively skewed while developing category is positively skewed.
# Underdeveloped category has the largest interquartile range showing how dispered the data is. Developing and Developed categories have comparable interquartile range.

# Since there was no clear relation between GDP and freedom, we decided to verify it using Pearson Correlation Test

# Testing our Hypothesis 1
# Hypothesis 1: There is a strong re;ation between GDP per capita and Freedom 
# H0: there is a strong correlation between the GDP per Capita and Freedom
# H1: there is a weak/low correlationbetween GDP per Capita and Freedom 
cor.test(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita, year2018sub$Freedom)
# The test returned a value of 0.33 indicating a low level of correlation between the two variables. Thus, we can reject our Null Hypothesis(H0). 

# Testing our Hypothesis 2
# Hypothesis 2: There is a strong re;ation between GDP per capita and Life Expectancy.  
# H0: there is a strong correlation between the GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy
# H1: there is a weak/low correlationbetween GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy 
cor.test(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita, year2018sub$Life_expectancy)
# The test returned a value of 0.84 indicating a high level of correlation between the two variables. Thus, our Null Hypothesis can be accepeted.

# Comment on graph 
# We can clearly see that Underdeveloped nations have higher happiness score as compared to the countries who are developed.

# Testing our Hypothesis 3
# Hypothesis 2: There is a strong re;ation between GDP per capita and Happiness Score
# H0: there is no correlation between the GDP per Capita and Happiness Score
# H1: there is a strong correlation: GDP per Capita and Happiness Score
# We applied the linear model testing to test our hypothesis ## apply correlation
GDPandHAPPINESS3 %>%
  lm(GDP.per.capita ~ `year_2018$Score`, data = .) %>% summary()
# The test returned a very small p-value (2e-16) and a R-squared of 0.64 indicating strong correlation between GDP per Capita & Happiness Score
# Therefore, H0, the null hypothesis can be rejected
# The result of this hypothesis test is supported by the scatter plot above between GDP per Capita & Happiness Score which shows a negative correlation between the two variables
# Thus, we can conclude that countries with higher GDP score higher on the happiness index because greater economic growth implies higher health expectancy and freedom to make independent choices
