# R project - Happinness Scores Analysis
# Group: Parimal Maurya, Rashi Singh, Fausto Diodati

# The dataset we retrieved from "Kaggle" is analyzed to determine the relationship between Happiness Index Score in 2018 and a number of
# independent variables such as 'Overall rank', 'GDP per capita', 'Social support', 'Healthy life expectancy', 'Freedom to make life choices',
# 'Generosity' and 'Perceptions of corruption'.
# The dataset is composed of Happiness Index scores of 156 countries
# along with information regarding Their per capita GDP which represents the economic well-being of citizens,
# The social support quantifies the degree to which people have access to social networks including family and friends,
# The healthy life expectancy measures how long people may expect to live in excellent health
# The freedom to make decisions in life demonstrates how much control and autonomy people have over their lives,
# and finally, The perception of corruption helps us to understand how prevalent it is in that society.

# The information included in the dataset includes the following variables:
# Overall rank: the number of total countries observed
# Quantitative - numeric
# Original Variable Name: Overall rank
# Country or region: The countries whose above mentioned varaibles are calculated
# Qualitative - character
# Original Variable Name: Country or region
# Happiness score :The score of each country
# Qualitative - double
# Original Variable Name: Score
# GDP per capita: Gross Domestic Product per capita for every country
# Qualitative - double
# Original Variable Name: GDP per capita
# Social support

# Original Variable Name: Social support
# Healthy life expectancy

# Original Variable Name: Healthy life expectancy
# Modified Variable Name: Life expectancy
# Freedom to make life choices

# Hypothesis Testing: GDP per Capita & Happiness Score
# H0: there is no correlation between the GDP per Capita and Happiness Score
# H1: there is a strong correlation: GDP per Capita ~ Happiness Score

# We applied the linear model testing to test our hypothesis
GDPandHAPPINESS3 %>%
lm(GDP.per.capita ~ `year_2018$Score`, data = .) %>% summary()
# The test returned a very small p-value (2e-16) and a R-squared of 0.64 indicating strong correlation between GDP per Capita & Happiness Score
# Therefore, H0, the null hypothesis can be rejected

# The result of this hypothesis test is supported by the scatter plot above between GDP per Capita & Happiness Score which shows a negative correlation between the two variables

# Thus, we can say that Countries with higher GDP score higher on the happiness index 
# because greater economic growth implies higher health expectancy and freedom to make independent choices
